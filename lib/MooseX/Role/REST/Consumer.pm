=head1 NAME

 MooseX::Role::REST::Consumer

=head1 VERSION

 version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Foo;
  use Moose;
  with 'MooseX::Role::REST::Consumer' => {
    service_host => 'somewhere.over.the.rainbow',
    resource_path => '/path/to/my/resource/:id',
  };

  my $object = Foo->get(route_params => {id => 1});

  if ($object->is_success) {
   print $object->data->{something_that_came_back};
  }

=head2 DESCRIPTION

  At Shutterstock we love REST and we take it so seriously that we think 
  our code should be RESTfully lazy. Now one can have a Moose model
  without needing to deal with all the marshalling details.

=head3 Schema Definitions/Configuration

  When setting up a class the following are the supported
  parameters that L<MooseX::Role::REST::Consumer> will support.

  For example a typical configuration would looke like the following:

  with 'MooseX::Role::REST::Consumer' => {
    service_host  => 'host.name',
    resource_path => '/path/to/my/resource/:id'
    timeout       => 10,
  };

=over

=item content_type

  By default the content type is set to "application/json"

=item header_exclude 

  Acts as a filter, will exclude any header information.

  header_exclude => {
    post => 'X-Foo',
  }

=item resource_path

  This is the path of the resource. IE:

  /foo/bar/:id

  The :id is a route parameter which will be filled in as specified by the
  "route_params" hashref.

=item retry

  This is an explicit retry. Even if the service times out, it will retry
  using this value. This retry is different than what L<REST::Consumer> offers.

=item service_host

  The hostname to the service

=item service_port

  The port for the hostname.

=item timeout

  Configuration level timeout. This is global on each request.

=item useragent_class

  Experimental way of overriding L<REST::Consumer>'s useragent. Right now
  MooseX::REST::Consumer uses L<LWP::UserAgent>

=back

=head3 METHODS

=over

=item get( route_params => {...}, params => {...} )

 Will use REST::Consumer::get to lookup a resource by
 supplied resource_path and substitution of route_params

=item post( route_params => {...}, content => '...' )

 Will perform a POST request with REST::Consumer::post.
 The data will the Content-Type of application/json by default.

=item Other supported HTTP methods

  DELETE and PUT: delete(%params) and put(%params)

=back

=head3 Supported Method Parameters

=over

=item route_params => {...}

 These will be substituted into the package route definition.

=item params => {...}

 Passed into L<REST::Consumer> as a set of key/value
 query parameters.

=item headers => {...}

  Any extra HTTP request headers to send. 

=item content => ''

  Passed into L<REST::Consumer>. This is the body content of a request.

=item timeout => ''

  Timeout override per request.
  
  Note that the 'timeout' is subject to interpretation
  by your underlying UserAgent class.  For example,
  LWP::UserAgent treats the timeout as being
  C<per-request>. This means that if you specify a timeout
  of 5 seconds and issue a request using LWP::UserAgent,
  each request that the UserAgent makes to fulfill your
  request will have its own timeout of 5 seconds.
  
  This becomes important if the API that you are talking to
  starts giving you 3xx redirects: while you might expect a
  timeout to occur within 5 seconds, the API might instruct
  your UserAgent to make a few subsequent requests, and each
  one will have your initial timeout applied to it.
  
  Different UserAgent classes implement timeouts
  differently. L<LWP::UserAgent::Paranoid>, for example,
  has a global timeout value, where all requests must be
  fulfilled within C<timeout> clock seconds.

=back

=head3 Response Object

=over

  The response object is created and passed back whenever
  any of the supported HTTP methods are called. 
  See L<MooseX::Role::REST::Consumer::Response>.
